Ecommerce-UI-Project
Project Overview
The Ecommerce-UI-Project is a front-end web application that simulates an online store. It allows users to view products by categories and switch between grid and list views. The product details, such as images, descriptions, sizes, and colors, are fetched dynamically from an external API. This project showcases a well-structured, responsive, and interactive user interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
